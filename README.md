# VCleaner
A simple cleaner for Linux
by VKing34thas

This program combines some commands to clean up apt cache, old config files, old kernels and trashes in your Linux.

It's just a simple program.

The requirement used here is "aptitude". But don't worry about how to install it cause the program will check and ask for installing in process.

+ How to install:
  1, Download "vcleaner.sh" ( I recommend you to copy it into root "/" so you can run right after opening terminal)
  2, Execute "vcleaner.sh" by the command: chmod +x vcleaner.sh
  
 + How to use:
    1, There's only one step to run this program. Type: ./vcleaner.sh
